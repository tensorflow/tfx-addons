#### SIG TFX-Addons
# Project Proposal

**Your name:** Nirzari Gupta

**Your email:** nirzu97@gmail.com

**Your company/organization:** Outreachy

**Project name:** [Feature selection custom component](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfx-addons/issues/7)

## Project Description
This project provides a facility to perform various feature selection algorithms on datasets in TFX pipelines. Additionally, feature scores for selected features will also be generated as a custom artifact.

## Project Category
Component

## Project Use-Case(s)
This project will allow the user to select different algorithms for performing feature selection on datasets artifacts in TFX pipelines.

## Project Implementation
Feature Selection Custom Component will be implemented as Python function-based component.
Implementation of the Feature Selection Custom Component can be done using the following approach:
- Get dataset artifact generated by ExampleGen
- Convert it into the format compatible with Scikit-Learn functions
- Perform univariate feature selection using parameters given by users
- Remove not selected features from the dataset
- Provide feature scores of the selected features as a custom artifact

## Project Dependencies
The implementation will use the [Scikit-learn feature selection functions](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_selection.html)
